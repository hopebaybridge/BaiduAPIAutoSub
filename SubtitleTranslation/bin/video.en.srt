00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,540
Correct configuration can improve their operation efficiency

10
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,110
First let's take a look

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,420
How to be correct on win10 system

12
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,480
to configure

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,000

34
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,580
You'll see

35
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,180
This one by one program directory

36
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,630
Put you in the local

Program directory

39
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,500
We build

40
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:09,860
after

41
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:10,840
Put it here

42
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,710
Click OK after placement

43

as for

45
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,770
Win7

46
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,500
system

47
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,870
It could be

48
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,320
Not in this form

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
You need to pay attention

50
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,850
Add ";"

51
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,610
English symbols

52
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,900

53
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,860


54
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,070
this

55
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,030
I configured it on disk e

56
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,910


57
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,430
When you install the program, try not to install it in

58
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,510

59
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,720

Install the other drive letter

63
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,010
Otherwise, it will get more and more stuck

64
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,910
I put it on this "e disk"

65
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,290
Just

66
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,240

Just put it here and make sure

77
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,650
Because I have already configured it, cancel this point

78
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,820
Next, click the OK button

79
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,410

edit

86
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,500
Put this

87
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,300
JAVA_ Home variable

88
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,670
After the "%" sign in front of the place

89
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,000
Add at the back

90
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,280
"Bin" directory

91
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,480
That's it

92

It's configured

96
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,150
Let's take a look at Mac

97
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,880
And Linux

98
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,370
How to configure

99
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,040
environment variable

100
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,250
Next, let's turn on the Mac

101
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,500
Folder found

102
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,370

105
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,700
Variable configuration

106
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,830
It's in a hidden

find

109
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,440
After home directory

110
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,170
Hold it down at the same time

111
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,000

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,090
Show hidden files

115
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,710
And then we'll find out

116
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,090


117
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,270

configuration file

124
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,220
This is what I configured

125
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,870
MAC system environment variable

126
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,540
You find

Maven

133
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,530
Let's see

134
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,950
This profile

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,020
Find it

137
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,790
That's it

138
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,350
take

139
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,710

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:12,950
Import

144
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,960
Here is the "$" sign

145
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,390
Not like

146
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,690
win10

147
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,030
Add a percent sign on both sides

148
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,480
Attention

149
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,470
There's a difference

150
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,040
After configuration

151
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,250
Keep it

152
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,930
And

153
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,850
Terminal command

157
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,660
That's it

158
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,580

"mvn --version"

160
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,670
So the environment variables on the MAC system are

161
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,200
Just

162
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,730

226
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:41,100
It's not the same as the MAC file name

227
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,250
We

228
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,770
Open with a text editor

229
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,570
You'll also see

00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,100
Environment variable configuration

232
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,290
This environment variable follows the

233
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,590
MAC system

234
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,580
The method is the same

235
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,460
Find your

236
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,330

246
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,160
Add bin directory

247
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,310
also

248
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,020
Save after adding

249
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,840
At the terminal, the same

250
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,700
input

251
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,370

such

256
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,060
That's it

257
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,150
We can

258
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,280
Like: MAC system at terminal

259
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,990
like that

260
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,030

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,320


266
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,190
Edit on the command line

267
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,830
It's ok

268
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,990
In Linux system, you can quickly

269
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,480
find

270
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:30,510
You installed

271
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,910
program

272
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:33,970
For example:

273
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:35,960


274
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,430
We input

275
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,550
type

276
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:40,640
java

277
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,630
You'll find it quickly

278
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,120
java

279
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,590
Installed programs

catalog

281
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,570
Then configure

282
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,840
it's fine too

283
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,970
"whereis

284
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,340

u201cls -lrt"

287
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,740
take

288
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,700
this

289
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,500
Execution command of bin directory

290
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,430
Paste it here

291
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,780
same

292
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,220
You can also find it

293
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,500
its

294
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:22,910
Installation directory

295
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,650
Or

296
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:28,880
which

297
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,900
java

298
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,170
You can also find it

299
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,550
The difference is

300
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,980
Linux system follows

301
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,050
MAC system

302
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,470
configuration file

303
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,830
name

304
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,530
dissimilarity

305
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,650
You need to pay attention

306
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,500
In this way, the environment variables of Linux system

307
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,060
So it's configured

308
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:10,750
When you use VIM, you need to pay attention to: you can't use VIM without installation, you need to use vim

309
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:20,750
"Sudo apt install VIM" for Mac

310
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:30,750
Brew install VIM; for example, CentOS or other systems, change "apt install VIM" to "Yum install VIM"u201c

311
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,430
Or other orders, that's all

312
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,540
